# Online-Electrical-Caluclator
This is a very useful calculator application for ⚡Electrical, 🔌Electronics Engineers and 🧑‍🔬engineering students. This web application can perform basic calculations and estimations which can be very useful for engineers at their work place and it also can solve some engineering problems like electricity consumption calculation and electricity bill estimations. The speciality of this project is that the whole code logic is programmed 💡server side and that is not visible for users😶‍🌫️. But still you can see my backend programming in this repository😉.

# Features:
1. Name based Gender Prediction.
2. Electricity Consumption calculation.
3. Electricity bill Estimation.
4. Current requirement based wire thickness estimation.
5. Single phase generator speed calculation and Load Power factor calculation.
6. Application based Earthing resistance information.
7. Full laws based calculations(Ohms Law, Current Law, Power Law).
